# State Machine Simulation: Requirement

## Functional Requirement

- [ ] Process the string input to get the result that can tell us that the string input is valid or not?

### State

- [ ] State has its own value to denote the state name.
- [ ] State has multiple links to another state, each link has the code to denote their way to the another state.
- [ ] Each link from the state can show us which terminal state is leaded to be, by using the code.

### State Machine

- [ ] Assign which state is the start state, which is the finish state.
- [ ] It can process the input to find that the code is valid or not.
